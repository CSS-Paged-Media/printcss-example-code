      <h1>PrintCSS: Widows and Orphans</h1>
      <p>There is the concept of widows and orphans in typography, which describes lines of a paragraph that appear alone.</p>
      <p>Orphans are the first lines of a paragraph that appear at the bottom of a page. On the other hand, widows are the last lines of a paragraph appearing on the top of a page.</p>
      <p>Usually, you do not want a single line of a paragraph to be alone on the bottom or top of a page.</p>
      <p>There are the CSS properties 'widow' and 'orphan' to take care of such' lonely' lines. The integer you are passing as a value to these properties defines the minimum number of lines that can be alone.</p>
      <p>Let's start with a basic HTML and CSS file and see the result on printcss.live with DocRaptor as the selected rendering tool. Of course, you can render the PDF with the other tools too, but be aware that not all rendering tools support this concept yet.</p>
