            <p>
                If you want to use HTML inside the page margin boxes, you will need to use running elements. These elements are normal HTML nodes with the CSS position property set to 'running(NAME)'.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name given to the running element is used within the page margin boxes to set their content to the running elements inner HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                To do so, you need to set the specific page margin box's CSS content property to 'element(NAME)', where NAME is the given running element name.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elements with the position running do not appear in the document until you assign them to some CSS content property.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your running elements must come first in your HTML structure. For example, if you put the footer element before the closing body tag, the running footer will only appear on the last page.
            </p>
            
            <h1 id="toc">PrintCSS: Table of Contents</h1>

            <p>A very common use case for your PrintCSS document is creating a table of contents. But how would you know the page numbers of your chapters before you render the document? The content takes as many pages as it needs and if your content is dynamic it is impossible to say how many pages a chapter would result in.</p>

            <p>Before we start with our table of contents we will need some content to create the table for. So let's take the result from my previous article PrintCSS: Running Headers and Footers and extend the content.</p>
